  @moduledoc """
  Macros for handling much of the boilerplate of command creation.

  Most of the callbacks of the `Spanner.GenCommand` behaviour are
  metadata-related, used to drive the automatic generation of command
  bundle configuration files. While these 0-arity functions can be
  defined directly, it can be rather verbose. Additionally, by using
  macros, we can provide compile-time checks to ensure that permission
  rules are actually syntactically valid, that they refer to the
  command being generated, etc.

  If you are writing an Elixir-based command, you should start off with

      use #{inspect __MODULE__}

  Then you'll have access to all the metadata macros, and also get a
  few other callback functions defined for you.

  ## Configuration

  You can declare various command configuration parameters in code;
  these will be introspected to automatically generate a command
  bundle.

  ### Command Name

  By default, the command name (i.e., how you will invoke the command
  via the bot, and how you will refer to it in invocation rules) is
  the lower-cased terminal segment of the module name. That is, if you
  implement a command in the `MyCompany.My.Great.Command.Foo`, then
  the command name will be `foo`.

  If you wish to override this, you should pass the desired name in
  with your `#{inspect __MODULE__}` use statement.

      defmodule This.Is.My.SuperSnazzyCommand do
        use #{inspect __MODULE__}, name: "super-command"
        # ...
      end

  The name can be inspected at runtime with the `command_name/0`
  callback, which the module generates for you.

      This.Is.My.SuperSnazzyCommand.command_name() # => "super-command"

  ### Enforced/Secure Commands

  By default commands enforced, meaning they require permissions to run.
  Optionally users can opt-out and set 'enforcing' to false, requiring no
  permissions to run. Un-enforced commands should be used sparingly and are most
  useful for commands that do simple text processing and never call out to
  outside services. `operable:echo` and `operable:table` are good examples of
  un-enforced commands.

  To opt-out set the enforcing flag to false when using the command macro.
  true when using #{inspect __MODULE__}

  Example:

      defmodule MyPrimitiveCommand do
        use #{inspect __MODULE__}, enforcing: false

        # ...
      end

  ### Options

  All commands can specify options, using the `option/1` macro.

      defmodule MyCommand do
        use #{inspect __MODULE__}

        option "option_1", required: true
        option "option_2", type: "string", required: true

        # ...

      end

  These options can be inspected at runtime using
  `options/0`, which the module generates for you.

  ### Permissions

  Commands may require certain permissions to run. The union of all
  permissions of all commands in a bundle will be created in the
  system when the bundle is installed.

  Permissions may be declared using the `permission/1` macro.

      defmodule MyCommand do
        use #{inspect __MODULE__}

        permission "admin"

        # ...

      end

  Permissions can be inspected at runtime using `permissions/0`, which
  the module generates for you.

  ### Rules

  Upon installation, each bundle can create one or more invocation
  rules that control who is allowed to execute each command. Operators
  are free to keep these rules, delete them, edit them, or create
  their own.

  By specifying these initial rules, command authors can provide users
  with a more complete command installation experience, allowing them
  to start using commands more quickly.

  By specifying rules in code, your command will not even compile if
  the rule syntax is incorrect.

  Rules may be declared using the `rule/1` macro.

      defmodule MyCommand do
        use #{inspect __MODULE__}

        permission "admin"

        rule "when command is my-bundle:my-command must have my-bundle:admin"

        # ...
      end

  Multiple rules may be specified (just invoke `rule/1` repeatedly)

  If any rule is invalid, an error will be raised at compile time.

  All valid rules are available at run time by calling `rules/0`,
  which the module generates for you.
